    "Require age between 6-24h - trades in this age range had the highest win rate (46.2%) among all age categories.",

    "Prioritize tokens showing a *pressure_heavy_buying* pattern rather than merely normal volume, because this category delivers an average ROI of **+527.9\u202f%** and a win rate of **37.5\u202f%** (8 trades), outperforming the vol_normal group (+504\u202f% ROI, 33.3\u202f% win).",
